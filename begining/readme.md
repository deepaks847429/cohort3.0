// react and nextjs are framework, and they compile back in html, js , css.
// properties of javascript
//1. interpreted- meaning it is executed line by line.
->in c++ we first compile and then run but in js we can write our code and run together(compilation and run go together).

2. dynamically typed.
3. single threaded.-> at max we can use 1 cpu at a time.
4. Garbage collected-> javascript automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation through garbage collection, which helps prevent memory leaks automatically reclaiming memory used by objects mo longer in use.
